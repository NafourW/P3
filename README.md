# Tour Planning Application



## Setup

#### Running the software:

In order to run the application, a local MySQL database is needed.

The easiest way to set it up, is to download [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and start MySQL.

The application should automatically connect to the database,

otherwise make sure it is hosted on port 3306,

and that you can connect with user root and an empty password.



#### Libraries required:

In order to compile the application these libraries must be present:

1. mysql-connector-java 

   can be downloaded from Maven (mysql:mysql-connector-java:5.1.40)

2. [graphhopper-tools-0.4.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/493773814711189514/519472014063304704/graphhopper-tools-0.4.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar)
